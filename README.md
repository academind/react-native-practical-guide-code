# React Native - The Practical Guide Code & Course Materials

This repository contains code snapshots and other attachments (e.g., slides) for our [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://acad.link/react-native) course.

You may use the provided resources to follow along with the course, debug your code or to compare your solution to Maximilian's. Re-distributing course materials (including the content provided with this repository) is not permitted.

# How To Navigate This Repository

1. The `/code` folder is separated into the different course sections

   - each section contains multiple snapshots throughout the section

2. The `/attachments` folder is also separated into different course sections and contains any relevant attachments from the section, as well as starting snapshots (if applicable)

3. The `/slides` folder contains any relavant pdf documents of all the slides in this course, split across sections

# Using Code Snapshots

Code snapshots (which you find in `/code/<section-name>/`) are there for you to compare your code to mine and find + fix errors you might have in your code.

You can either view my code directly here on Github (you can open + view code files without issues here) or you download the snapshots. To download (or [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)) the snapshots, simply use the **"Code" button** in the top right corner of the repository. This allows you to download the currently selected branch. You can then browse the code snapshots locally on your machine.

The subfolders in the `/code` folder are named such that mapping them to the course sections is straightforward (inside of which you will find intermittent snapshots throughout each section).

# Running The Provided Code

The provided code is primarily meant to be used for code comparisons (i.e., so that you can compare your code to mine to find + fix errors).

But you can also run my project code by navigating into the respective code section snapshots folder (i.e., a subfolder in the `/code` folder) and executing `npm install` followed by `npm start` there.

Please note that dependency mismatches could lead to errors here, even if the provided code itself still works and is correct. In addition, you will always need to bring your own backend URLs (e.g., Firebase) or API keys, if any were used in the course section!
